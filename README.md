# Photo Ranker

Photo Ranker is a web application designed to offer an unbiased and fun way to rank photos. By presenting two random pictures side-by-side for a binary vote, it removes the gray area often found in traditional 1-10 rating systems.

## Motivations

The goal of Photo Ranker is to address a common problem: receiving honest feedback on photos. Friends and acquaintances might be too kind, while numerical ratings can lead to indecision and biases. Photo Ranker's binary choice system, inspired by the Glicko-2 algorithm used in chess, aims to:

- **Make Voting Fun:** The side-by-side approach makes voting an engaging experience.
- **Reduce Biases:** The binary choice is clear and deterministic.
- **Help Users Select Their Best Picture:** Especially useful when undecided between photos.
- **Allow Customizable Experience:** Filter who sees and votes on your photos.

## Features

- **Voting System:** Users choose their favorite between two random photos.
